# InvoiceManager-3.0

My first commercial project.

Process of Invoice recipt to goods recipt in logistic department was tracked in excel file. Due to larg nr of incomming invoices this procces need to be mapped in DB.

Application will be made of 3 components:
1. Web app - for DB view and editing records
2. Outlook addin - most of the process is tracked based on recived e-mails
3. Excel sheet - for reporting
